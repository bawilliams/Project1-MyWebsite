                <h1 class="title">Biography</h1>
                <p>On October 3, 1992, I was born in Richmond, the hipster mecca of the East Coast. As a child, I loved exploring outdoors when it was nice out and playing videogames when it wasn't. Particularly, I loved Japanese videogames such as the Final Fantasy series, Chrono Cross, Zelda games, and the Shadow of the Colossus.</p>
                <p>When it came time to go to college, I decided to go to UVA, because of their prestigious medical school and their strong Japanese program. I soon found out, like most students at UVA, that pre-med was not the right career path for me and switched to a Foreign Affairs and Japanese double major to become a translator.</p>
                <p>Coming from a smaller city, I always wanted to travel and see more of the world and with my hopes of becoming a translator, I set my sights on Japan. I studied abroad there for a semester in the winter and spring of 2014; getting to visit a part of the world that I never imagined I would get the opportunity to see was an amazing experience. While I was there, I interned as a translator and realized that even though I loved learning the language, becoming a translator was no longer something that would make me happy in the future. Although I loved my time in Japan, the further I went from Richmond, the more it grew on me.</p>
                <p>Routing a new course, I then decided to study business after taking business classes in Japan and thoroughly enjoying them. This led me to join the M.S. in Commerce program at UVA and study Business Analytics. There I learned everything from finance to accounting to data analytics. I was incredibly fortunate to once again get to travel abroad through the program; this time, I visited Japan, multiple cities on mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. </p>
                <p>During my time in the program, I happened upon Red Ventures and somehow the company just clicked with me; I liked that I could make an immediate impact and that there are lots of opportunities for growth and change like the ITA program. Now, I work as a business analyst by day and novice programmer and rock-climber by night (and on the weekends).</p>
